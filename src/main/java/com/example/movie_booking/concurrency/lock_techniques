Lock needed on Seat
1. How the system shoudl behave when two users try to book same seat?
if there were only one application server, putting lock at application level is not possible . the use of sunchronisation.
hence the need of lock on database level.

app server sends request to theter api and lock on db.
isolation level of db: 1. read commited; row wise lock
if user is not able to lock the seat, send error to user that seat is not available.

if withing the time the payment is not done then api server sends request to cancel the booking.


There are two types of dbs used in the system: rdbs(relation between screen movie)  and no sql (all unstructured data: comments, reviews);
user session data; tracking data for user also can be in no sql. this can pased to spark ml --> for user recommendations.
