9. You should also discuss with the interviewer that whether he would like to have different operational zones or sectors in the elevator system. A zone is the set of floors that are covered by a set of elevators. E.g. In our case of 200 floors and 100 elevators, we can, e.g., divide all the floors into 4 zones: From 1â€“50: operated by 25 elevators
When we use multiple zones in a building along with a set of elevators assigned to a zone then we can treat each zone independently from each other.
