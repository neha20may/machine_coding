The only actor in elevator system is the passenger, which is the role that humans play when interacting with the system.
The passenger interacts with the Elevator system by making car calls and hall calls.
The passenger also makes decision whether to enter/leave the car or not by observing the indication of moving direction and car position.
Therefore the use case diagram shows that the actor has relationship with four use cases of the system: Process Car Calls, Process
Hall calls, Indicate Moving Direction, and Indicate Car Position.

Process car(cabin) calls:
this use case has several scenarios:
1. Elevator receives car calls from passengers
2. turn on / tun off light of car call buttons
3. updates the records of car calls stored in system controlling parts

Process Hall calls:
1. Elevator receives hall class calls from passengers
2. tunrs on / off light of Hall call buttons
3. updates the records of Hall calls stored in system controlling parameters

Indicating Moving Direction:
1. The elevator should have this mechanism to let the passengers know the current moving direction of the car such that the passenger might
decide whether to enter the car or not.

Indicating Car Position:
1. Similarly, the elevator should let the passengers know whether
his/her destination floor is reached so that the passenger may decide to leave the car.

Open/Close the Doors:
1. The elevator should be able to open and close the doors for the passengers to get in and out of the car.
2. The functional areas of this use case should also enable the passengers to make door reversals when the doors are closing and the
passenger wants to get in the car.

Trigger Emergency Brake:
1. There is safety mechanism within the car to make sure that an
unsafe state is not transiently generated.
